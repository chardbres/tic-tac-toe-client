User stories for tic-tac-toe:

1. As a general user, I want to be able to sign in/sign out/change password, using an unintrusive interface of well-designed form fields.
2. As a player, I want to be able to very clearly see the current status of the game board, so that I don't have to keep track of the game on my own, and know where I can still play.
3. As a player, I want to be able to see a running tally of games won/lost/total played, so that I can track game results over time.
